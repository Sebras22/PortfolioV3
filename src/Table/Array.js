For me, it's not just about the development process; I'm equally passionate about the conception, design, and architecture construction of each project.

My hardskills are various, for example with UI and UX, I took the habit to look on different platforms the styles, the new ways to make a website or an app more liekable; also when I do my designs for my projects I always think about the way I will do it, and I make a simple design but efficient. In devlopement I'm used to work with Visual Studio Code, using frameworks like ReactJS principaly. For various projects I used things like Pocketbase as an online database, easier to implement and to use.",
